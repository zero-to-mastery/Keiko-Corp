# Keikocorp.com - Hacktoberfest 2020

Welcome to this year's HTML challenge for Hacktoberfest ([What is Hacktoberfest?](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/coding_challenge-31/blob/master/README.md#what-is-hacktoberfest)) A project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing HTML, CSS & maybe a dash of JavaScript to achieve a simplistic yet elegant website for the greatest start up of all time; Keiko Corp.

Everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of your skill level. This is a practice project and should be considered a playground. This project has plenty of options for collaboration, here are just a few of the many that we welcome pull requests for:-

- HTML elements.
- CSS styling.
- Images.
- Text/Copy.
- Documentation.
- Fix Typos, Code Bugs or Accessibility oversights.

## Project Brief

Incredibly, Bruno the CEO of Keiko Corp has built the fastest growing tech start up in Silicon Valley, without ever having launched a website. Bruno's marketing team is insisting that they need a website in order to gain the confidence of the potential clients to reach this quarters sales targets.

Bruno has put together a quick [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/NY0Do1PFf4xl0ZuSTA1X9U/Keiko-Corp-Hacktoberfest-Project?node-id=2%3A10g) to demonstrate the layout and simplistic design they are looking for. Although Bruno did request the website be as immaculate and as impressive as his hair, the design is totally open to interpretation and modification during the first iteration of development.

## Getting Started

Ok, so you have read the brief and checked out the [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/NY0Do1PFf4xl0ZuSTA1X9U/Keiko-Corp-Hacktoberfest-Project?node-id=2%3A10). Ready to contribute, but not sure how or where to start?

> If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open-source project, we recommend taking a look at our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). This repo has everything you need to learn about open-source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR.
> Once you've got your feet wet, you're ready to come back and dive into Hacktoberfest fun!

1. First up you need to fork (make a copy) this repo to your Github account.
2. Clone (download) your fork to your computer.
3. Set your streams so you can sync your clone with the original repo (get the latest updates).

   - `git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Keiko-Corp.git`
   - `git pull upstream master`
   - The above 2 commands will synchronize your forked version of the project with the actual repository.

4. Find a task [here](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Keiko-Corp/issues) or [create a task](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Keiko-Corp/issues)
   - Comment on the task to claim it, ensuring no-body has done so already.
   - If you created a new task or issue, ensure you specify if you are undertaking the task or if someone else is able to claim it.
   - Keep the issue updated with your progress, inactive issues will be reassigned.
5. Create a branch for your task and complete the task.
6. Pull from the upstream again, like we did in step 3. This is to ensure we still have the latest code.
   - `git pull upstream master`
7. Commit and push the code to your fork.
8. Create a pull request to have the changes merged into the origin.
   - Ensure you add to the comments of the pull request `fixes #<issue number>`, replacing **<issue number>** with the number of your issue will automatically close the issue when the pull request is merged.
9. [Tweet about making your first Hacktoberfest pull request](https://ctt.ac/1KI1u)
